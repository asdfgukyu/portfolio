This book contains the projects I’ve done throughout my degree in MSc Urban Spatial Science at the Centre of Advance Spatial Analysis, UCL.\nI have a background in cultural production and a BA in Geography from the LSE, before I made the switch to urban analytics, especially looking at transport sustainability. So you will find a mixture of these themes in throughout this book!\nThis book is created from R markdown and executable code."

    "text": "1.2 Premise\nThe 15-minute city has become a popular urban planning concept in recent years, popularised by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Carlos Moreno for their plans to created a polycentric Paris.\nHowever there has been little definitive definition of what a 15-minute city looks like, and how it should be measured.\nI wanted to challenge the concept further to investigate how gender, safety preferences, household responsibilities, traffic and the urban landscape produce inequality in access in local areas. How does women’s greater fear of crime and propensity to stay on main roads influence their overall travel time in relation to their male counterparts?\nThis study focuses on accessibility of spaces by foot within a virtual urban environment, using Agent Base Modelling, accounting for traffic, lighting, and the gendered behaviour of residents due the real or perceived risk of crime.\nThis model is generated and executatble in Netlogo. Code and Agent Based Model Design Concepts and Details (ODD) available on Github.\n\n\nThe model is evaluated by its ability to reproduce the average duration for individual agents with different genders and caring responsibilities to reach a destination. The level of traffic can be adjusted to stimulate the bottleneck nature of roads, increasing wait and journey time of travelers with tendency to walk on busy main roads. Street lights can also be turn as a toggle function, which increase the number of roads for travelers with higher propensity for safety to walk on, reducing travel time."

    "text": "3.2 Premise\nIn response to growing contention of Airbnb’s impact on local housing market and affordable homes, I worked with a group of 4 to create a policy brief which provided an alternative explanation to the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings, in relations to existing hotel industry and cultural infrastructures in London.\nThis model is generated and executable in Python. Code and policy brief available on Github.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs anticipated, the distribution of Airbnb listings is very similar to instances of cultural infrastructure, with the highest density of listings in the centre of the city and a gradual sprawl outward towards Zone 2. This supports the prediction that Airbnb listings cluster around areas with many cultural offerings in the city. This is distinct from patterns in the hotel industry; 50% of hotels are listed in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea alone. The hotel industry loosely follows the distribution of cultural infrastructure in central London, with fair proximity to more established and well-known cultural spaces. However, there is a clear disconnect between hotel supply and cultural offerings beyond Zone 1. Indeed, the hotel industry is much more rigid in operations due to the higher barriers to market entry (investment, planning permission and overheads). The slower adjustments in hotel supply therefore provide an opening in the market for Airbnbs, which are able to react quickly to market trends, responding to growing areas of demand with greater flexibility than hotels.\nOn a more granular scale, the analysis identified 5 distinct groups of hotel, Airbnb and cultural infrastructure agglomeration. Areas with relatively low hotel density, and medium cultural and Airbnb density illustrate Airbnb’s advantage as a flexible method of accommodation that can meet the demand of areas with many cultural amenities. Areas with these Airbnb-hotel-culture market proportions, which dominate most of central London and its surrounds, raise concerns about the potential reduction in housing stock and displacement of incumbent residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 areas (Westminister, Croydon, East London area) were used as case studies to illustrate place-specific nuances for the brief."
