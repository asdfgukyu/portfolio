# Stop Search and Frisk

## Technical Skills
R, QGIS, spatial weight matrix,  point pattern analysis, spatial autocorrelation, visualisation

## Premise
Tasked with a brief of examining the New York Police Department's stop, question and frisk (SQF) policy. I chose to investigate presence and severity of the Department's racially targeted overpolicing in 2021, after the Black Lives Matters protests. A point pattern analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis and various visualisations were produced.

This analysis was completed in exam conditions within 6 hours and executable in R. Code available on [Github](https://github.com/CASA0005-coursework/casa0005-final-exam-22-23-asdfgukyu).


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gis_general.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gis_anon.png")
```

Point pattern analysis allowed for evaluation of point data regardless of district or ward boundaries. Analysis shows there are 6 distinct clusters of high SQF but low hit rate against African Americans in the area. 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gis_dbscan.png")
```

Spatial auotcorrelation shows a cluster of districts in mid to upper Manhattan with high SQF with low hit rate in the Bronx, and north-eastern Queens and northern Brooklyn.
